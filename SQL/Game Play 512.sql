-- (player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
-- This table shows the activity of players of some games.
-- Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
 

-- Write a solution to report the device that is first logged in for each player.

-- Return the result table in any order.

-- The result format is in the following example.


# Write your MySQL query statement below
-- SELECT A2.player_id, A2.device_id FROM Activity A2 GROUP BY A2.player_id HAVING MIN(A2.event_date);

WITH
  min_data AS (
    SELECT
      A.player_id,
      MIN(A.event_date) AS event_date
    FROM
      Activity A
    GROUP BY
      A.player_id
  )
SELECT
  A2.player_id,
  A2.device_id
FROM
  Activity A2
  INNER JOIN min_data M ON M.player_id = A2.player_id
  AND M.event_date = A2.event_date;
